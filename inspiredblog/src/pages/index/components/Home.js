                Glad you came by.<br />
                I wanted to welcome you and let you know I appreciate you spending time here at the blog very much.
                Everyone is so busy and life moves pretty fast, so I really do appreciate you taking time out of your busy day to check out my blog. Thanks.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.paragraph}>
                Another thing I will always appreciate is your feedback to the blog. If you have any comments or suggestions I welcome them and would love to hear them. Always.
                Not that all criticism is a fun thing but I think honest criticism given in an honest positive manner is something we can all learn and grow from if we are open to hearing it.  
                I will always listen to your ideas. So I do welcome your suggestions for the blog...
            </div>
            <div className={classes.paragraph}>
                Always.
            </div>
            <div className={classes.paragraph}>
                I will always do my best to bring you content that will interest, inspire, motivate and maybe even have you walking away
                thinking about and seeing things in a different way than before you came.  I want to blog about more than just computer science
                andâ€¦  Life is so much more than that and I want to touch on everything because I think our lives are more than just sitting in front of screens.

            <div className={classes.paragraph}>
                This blog will always be changing because I am. You are. The world is. So donâ€™t get too comfortable. I like to surprise
                from time to time, I just might throw you a curve ball every now and then.  ðŸ˜‰

            <div className={classes.paragraph}>Thanks for letting me,</div>
